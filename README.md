## Work

I am an engineer with 9 years of experience working for a major aerospace company. 


## PhD

I have joined UConn's CFD Group in 2021 as a PhD student. I am working with higher order models such as Large Eddy Simulation (LES) applied to atmospheric problems. Plenty of HPC, MPI and a lot of interesting programming, including Fortran!
